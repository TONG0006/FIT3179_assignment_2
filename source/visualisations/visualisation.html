                The gameboard "chess" has been around for 1500 years with a rich history of rising and falling of top
                players. For some people it was a form of small entertainment and others, their career. The community of
                chess has been a small one, mostly with chess players themselves; however, with recent medias covering
                chess such as the Netflix series "Queen's gambit" and streaming platforms, the audience has grown
                significantly larger, even to those who don't play. And as such these visualisations will give a small
                insight on the current growth.

                The map visualises the number of players with GM titles over the world. The title Grandmaster is
                rewarded to a select few and is currently the highest title an individual may attain from the chess
                organisation Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE). The title has a strict regulation that a
                player must meet to attain this achievement.

            <p>
                The scatter plot analyses the trend between popularity of chess in a given country against rating
                performance. While the game chess has grown internationally, the elite few are grouped in a small number
                of countries. With larger population, the trend indicates a higher likelihood that a player emerges with
                a higher rating point but lower average.

                The standard time control or by FIDE is known as classical time format, is a time control with 120
                minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 60 minutes for moves 41-60 and 15 minutes with 30 seconds
                increment after moves 60. It is the traditional time format for tournaments and is often the longer type
                ones. Rapid time control does not have a fix time setting but instead defined by anything over ten
                minutes per player. And finally, blitz is anything between 3 to 10 minutes per player. There are many
                other time controls beside these, but these 3 are by far the standard for tournament standards.
