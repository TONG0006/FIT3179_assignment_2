                                of piece sacrificies to deliver a finisher onto Lionel Kieseritzky. Here is the game

                                - and quite possibly the most famous game of chess ever played. In it, Anderssen plays
                                the King's Bishop Gambit (which I am totally
                                unfamiliar with). After sacrificing a bishop, BOTH rooks, AND his queen, Anderssen
                                delivers a mate that is truly inspired by some higher power. How many of us GameKnot

                                having his king so exposed (and from such an early point), Anderssen attacks like a man
                                possesed (and after studying his games, I think
                                he very well may have been:) I will try to provide a commentary (with some liberal usage

                                through the heart. This is one of the most instructive games I have ever seen. It proves
                                that while maintaining material is important,
                                piece coordination and the concept of TIME can overcome such material deficits. The
                                funny thing is that this was just a skittles game - it had no bearing on any tournament
                                or serious play. Can you just imagine what was
                                going through the minds of Steinitz and other top players of that era when they saw
                                this? (assuming they ever did). I'm sure they probably thought that Anderssen was a
                                direct relative of Caissa:) I hope you have enjoyed
                                it:) More famous games are forthcoming, and I appreciate all the kind words I have

                                During a Vienna 1873 chess tournament, Wilhelm Seinitz demonstrated his form of
                                positional play that utilises key concepts such as such as controlling the center with
                                pawns, playing a closed position. The tournament consisted of 12 players strong
                                players from 6 different countries and he went ahead and took first place after
                                defeating Joseph Henry Blackburne in the finals.

                                His deployment of his theories for positional play had influenced many players and at

                                influential chess theoritician and had driven the community into the scientific era.

                                showed that over the long term, the setup can lead to more ferocious attacks than the
                                last generation. After the tournament, he was considered to be the strongest player in
                                the world and when the first official World Chess Championship was held in 1886, he took
                                the title of being the first official World Chess Champion.

                                {Many strong chess players and, of course, World Champions have found new
                                moves and ideas that changed the evaluation of different opening systems. But
                                just a few of us were lucky enough to introduce new plans that transformed the
                                core of opening and middlegame strategy. The impression and clarity of the
                                plan put forward by Steinitz in this game was so strong that the whole line
                                starting with 4.e5 was later called the "Steinitz Variation" in the French

                                play - to some extent it helped Steinitz to demonstrate the essence of his
                                plan in the purest form. The average international player simply couldn't
                                think in the long-term categories that marked Steinitz well thought out

                                Fast forward a few decades, chess has gone through multiple major theoretical

                                in tactical play. Once again another figure Aron Nimzowitsch, who is now known as the
                                founder and leading practionier of hypermodernism had challenged some of the ideas that
                                Steinitz had proposed.

                                restraint, rook on the seventh rank, knight outposts, the dynamics of the isolated

                                The visualisation above highlights a few important factors. Firstly how there is a huge
                                increase in GMs in the mid 1900s, how the chess community spreads geographically and
                                finally how population count does not corrolate with GM count.

                                While historically, females aren't widely restricted to the play in chess, they have a
                                much lower ratio against males. This was very much true in the past and FIDE had
                                encouraged many female players to play, opening up female only titles and tournaments.

                                While Polgár had retired in 2014, she had demonstrated a great example in the female
                                community, not just in chess but in a competitive nature against odd gender ratios.
                                Moreover, Polgár was also known to rarely play in women-specific tournaments and had
                                said in an interview that "I always say that women should have the self-confidence that
                                they are as good as male players, but only if they are willing to work and take it
                                seriously as much as male players." -- Judit Polgár.
