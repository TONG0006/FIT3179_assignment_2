                                of piece sacrificies to deliver a finisher onto Lionel Kieseritzky. Here is the game

                                - and quite possibly the most famous game of chess ever played. In it, Anderssen plays
                                the King's Bishop Gambit (which I am totally
                                unfamiliar with). After sacrificing a bishop, BOTH rooks, AND his queen, Anderssen
                                delivers a mate that is truly inspired by some higher power. How many of us GameKnot

                                material deficit? While the normal human would be scared senseless at the prospect of
                                having his king so exposed (and from such an early point), Anderssen attacks like a man
                                possesed (and after studying his games, I think
                                he very well may have been:) I will try to provide a commentary (with some liberal usage
                                of key points made by players far more keen than I) that will keep you tuned into the

                                through the heart. This is one of the most instructive games I have ever seen. It proves
                                that while maintaining material is important,
                                piece coordination and the concept of TIME can overcome such material deficits. The
                                funny thing is that this was just a skittles game - it had no bearing on any tournament
                                or serious play. Can you just imagine what was
                                going through the minds of Steinitz and other top players of that era when they saw
                                this? (assuming they ever did). I'm sure they probably thought that Anderssen was a
                                direct relative of Caissa:) I hope you have enjoyed
                                it:) More famous games are forthcoming, and I appreciate all the kind words I have

                                During a Vienna 1873 chess tournament, Wilhelm Seinitz demonstrated his form of
                                positional play that utilises key concepts such as such as controlling the center with
                                pawns, playing a closed position. The tournament consisted of 12 players strong
                                players from 6 different countries and he went ahead and took first place after
                                defeating Joseph Henry Blackburne in the finals.

                                His deployment of his theories for positional play had influenced many players and at

                                influential chess theoritician and had driven the community into the scientific era.

                                last generation. After the tournament, he was considered to be the strongest player in
                                the world and when the first official World Chess Championship was held in 1886, he took
                                the title of being the first official World Chess Champion.

                                moves and ideas that changed the evaluation of different opening systems. But

                                plan put forward by Steinitz in this game was so strong that the whole line
                                starting with 4.e5 was later called the "Steinitz Variation" in the French

                                play - to some extent it helped Steinitz to demonstrate the essence of his
                                plan in the purest form. The average international player simply couldn't
