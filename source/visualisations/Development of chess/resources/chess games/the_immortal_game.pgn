{The game that follows is my second Adolph Anderssen masterpiece. First
named 'the Immortal Game' by Austrian superstar Ernst Falkbeer, this is
perhaps Anderssen's finest work ever - and quite possibly the most famous
game of chess ever played. In it, Anderssen plays the King's Bishop Gambit
(which I am totally unfamiliar with). After sacrificing a bishop, BOTH
rooks, AND his queen, Anderssen delivers a mate that is truly inspired
by some higher power. How many of us GameKnot patzers would ever dream
of winning a game with a -21 material deficit? While the normal human would
be scared senseless at the prospect of having his king so exposed (and
from such an early point), Anderssen attacks like a man possesed (and after
studying his games, I think he very well may have been:) I will try to
provide a commentary (with some liberal usage of key points made by players
far more keen than I) that will keep you tuned into the mind of this master.
I hope you enjoy:)} 1. e4 e5 2. f4 {King's Gambit - an Anderssen favorite.}
exf4 {King's Gambit Accepted. In studying this opening a little, I have
learned that this is usually the best response for black. We must have
SOME King's Gambit players out there, and I would love to play against
you to become more familiar with this opening:)} 3. Bc4 {King's Bishop
Gambit. My research shows that 3. Nf3 is a much more standard response.}
Qh4+ 4. Kf1 b5 {Bryan's Counter-Gambit. Named for American ameteur Thomas
Jefferson Bryan who studied it extensively in Paris and London in the 19th
century. It aims to gambit a pawn while harrassing white's light squared
bishop. This kind of play is WAAAAY over my head. I think most of us would
agree that black needs to accelerate his development. But what do I know?}
5. Bxb5 {Regaining material equality.} Nf6 {Eying the e pawn.} 6. Nf3 {The
beginning of a developmental attack on the black queen.} Qh6 7. d3 {Protecting
e4, and aiming at f4. Supposedly, Anderssen spent a lot of time on this
one.....} Nh5 {Protecting the f pawn and threatening 8...Ng3 , winning
a rook for a knight.} 8. Nh4 {Does anyone else notice a seemingly non-chalant
attitude by Anderssen about his piece development? I have no idea what
would prompt such a move. There are PAGES of analysis about this move that
have been published.} Qg5 {Threatening 9...Qxh4 OR 9...Qxb5.} 9. Nf5 {The
only move to stop 9...Qxb5.} c6 {And it appears that the harrassment of
the bishop has begun.} 10. g4 {!  Anderssen is willing to let the bishop
fall as he starts a plan of attacking the black queen. First things first
though - that Nh5 need to be forced to a square that restricts the queen's
escape.} Nf6 11. Rg1 {!Sacrifice #1 - Bye Bye Bishop. Safer plays included
Ba4 or Bc4, but Anderssen had bigger plans.} cxb5 12. h4 {Notice the little
box that the black queen is trapped in.} Qg6 {Forced.} 13. h5 Qg5 {Forced
again.} 14. Qf3 {Threatening to play Bxf4 followed by e5.} Ng8 {Forced
yet again. Black has to create an escape path for his queen. We now approach
the 15th move of the game, and notice that now only one piece on the whole
board is developed!} 15. Bxf4 {Here comes the pain..........} Qf6 {Threatening
b2.} 16. Nc3 {Developing (finally!), protecting b2, and threatening the
strong Nd5.} Bc5 {Most top level players put a ? next to this move. Most
suggest 16...Na6. Why? I don't know....I'm just a 1500 level internet junkie:)
The attack on white's Rg1 is potent though (isn't it?).} 17. Nd5 {More
aggrevation for the black queen. White's b pawn is now hanging, but Anderssen
lives in the future, not the present.} Qxb2 {At last some relief from the
repeated attacks, and black gains yet another pawn while threatening white's
Ra1 with a check to boot. Anderssen was obviously aware of this, but he
had other ideas.......} 18. Bd6 {! Sacrifice #2 - Anderssen offers a rook
sacrifice. PAGES, (and I do mean PAGES) of possible alternatives were listed
in my research. White now has both rooks hanging. *'Rooks? We don't need
no stinking rooks!'*} Bxg1 {Black is now at  +8.} 19. e5 {!! Sacrifice
#3 - Anderssen now offers up the other rook! Remember - absinthe was still
legal back in those days, and it appears that he was drinking it heavily........or
was this simply a brilliant play?} Qxa1+ {Black is now  +13 and directly
attacking the enemy king.} 20. Ke2 {BAM!!!!!!!! Black is now at least two
moves away from delivering another check. Anderssen is now severely down
in MATERIAL, but has a massive advantage in TIME. Watch this...............}
Na6 {Protecting against 21. Nc7 , but white now has forced mate in 3.}
21. Nxg7+ {'Hello Mr. Black King! Would you kindly move to d8 please?'}
Kd8 {'Why certainly....do I have a choice?'} 22. Qf6+ {!! Sacrifice #4
- 'Hello again Mr. King! I just wanted to inform you of your impending
death:)'} Nxf6 {Forced.} 23. Be7# {And the dagger through the heart. This
is one of the most instructive games I have ever seen. It proves that while
maintaining material is important, piece coordination and the concept of
TIME can overcome such material deficits. The funny thing is that this
was just a skittles game - it had no bearing on any tournament or serious
play. Can you just imagine what was going through the minds of Steinitz
and other top players of that era when they saw this? (assuming they ever
did). I'm sure they probably thought that Anderssen was a direct relative
of Caissa:) I hope you have enjoyed it:) More famous games are forthcoming,
and I appreciate all the kind words I have received for posting them with
my own meager analysis.  Cheers!,    Thomas}  1-0
